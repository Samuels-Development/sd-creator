# sd-creator

It's relatively simple. 

Admins can use the '/createitem' command. After doing so, they'll see an "ox_lib" input dialog where they can set the item's details. Once they press "confirm," the complete string for the items.lua will be written into the items.txt file located in the resource's root directory. Same goes for Jobs, where admins can then create jobs via '/createjob' and then set all the job's settings as well as add as many grades as they want.
