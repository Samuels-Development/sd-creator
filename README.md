# sd-itemcreator

It's relatively simple. Admins can use the '/createitem' command. After doing so, they'll see an "ox_lib" input dialog where they can set the item's details. Once they press "confirm," the complete string for the items.lua will be written into the items.txt file located in the resource's root directory.
